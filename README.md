## Old Version
An older version of the loudener that uses a 1 ms attack time soft limit instead of soft clipping. It reduces crackling in higher frequencies but increases it in lower frequencies. It also has no final extra limiter like in the other versions and is slightly louder.

## Pre-soft clip
The normal version of the music loudener that doesnt apply the soft clipper or any other effects after it. This can be used if the other versions cause too much distortion.
