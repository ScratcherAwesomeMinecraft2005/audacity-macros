## Midtones
Reduces treble by 6 dB in the initial decomposition process. In most cases it won't increase treble as much as the normal version.

## Old Version
An older version of the loudener that uses a 1 ms attack time soft limit instead of soft clipping. It reduces crackling in higher frequencies but increases it in lower frequencies. It also has no final extra limiter like in the other versions and is slightly louder.
