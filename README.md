# audacity-macros
Some of my personal macros I made for [Audacity](https://github.com/audacity/audacity).

# List of macros

## [Music Loudener](https://github.com/ScratcherAwesomeMinecraft2005/audacity-macros/tree/music-loudener)
Makes music tracks really loud with minimal distortion at the cost of some ducking.

## [Rumble Enhancer](https://github.com/ScratcherAwesomeMinecraft2005/audacity-macros/tree/rumble-enhancer)
Applies a leveler distortion effect to low frequencies to make them more noticeable.

## [Bass and Treble Decompose](https://github.com/ScratcherAwesomeMinecraft2005/audacity-macros/tree/bass-decompose)
Perfectly separates the bass and treble of a track into two.

## [Ringverb](https://github.com/ScratcherAwesomeMinecraft2005/audacity-macros/tree/ringverb)
A reverb effect that increases the audio's speed slightly, causing a cool effect when applied more than once.
